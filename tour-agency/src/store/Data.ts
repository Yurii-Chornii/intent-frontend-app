The space has souped up Oman’s wild frontier to the max, with chasm-facing pool villas, majlis-style courtyards, a lantern-lit outdoor hookah space, and super-slick service. This being the splashy Gulf of Oman, there has to be a superlative or two: The hotel has the highest swimming pools, tennis court, and stargazing platform in the Middle East. But its real essence is pure escapism, whether rappelling down the side of a mountain or relaxing in the impeccable spa with its energizing hammam rituals and fragrant frankincense oils. It’s a bold, almost transcendental experiment in off-the-map tourism, and at the vanguard of a growing number of Middle Eastern hotels opening in unexpected and wonderfully extreme locations.",

Each bungalow has a deck—most with direct beach access—as well as its own golf cart and bikes for exploring the 96-acre island. And every morning, breakfast is delivered in a wicker basket, with treats from fresh fruit and juice to house-made pastries and hard-boiled eggs. And while the food at most Caribbean resorts is nothing to write home about, Kamalame stands out in the care it takes in its food, with rotating dishes like ceviche, seafood salads, crab-stuffed avocado, and Bahamian curry.

And, in the pop of an effervescent bubble, the region has its first modern five-star hotel (with the area’s only destination spa) as golden and whimsical as its namesake sparkler. Blonde wood and glass walls render the whole triple-deck interior Champagne-colored and the golden-leafed sculpture hanging in the atrium is truly lovely. Very large bedroom terraces, indoor and outdoor pools and jacuzzi all offer panoramic views of the world-famous (and now UNESCO World Heritage-listed) vineyards, while the top-floor bar has access to the cellar's 257 different Champagnes, as well as views that look over the vineyards. Restaurant Le Royal, with its giant images of Napoleon’s women and witty plates decorated with excerpts from his love letters, won a Michelin star within six months of opening; the casual restaurant, also overseen by chef Jean-Denis Rieubland, glitters beneath crystal pendants intended to evoke the gloss of Champagne. Everything, including the giant indoor pool, its tiles the turquoise of a mermaid’s tail, glows, but the effect is unexpectedly restful: even guests who don’t take advantage of a Biologique Recherche treatment will leave restored. But you’re here to drink Champagne in Champagne, which calls for a little bit of bling and indulgence.

It's been a go-to on the East Africa safari circuit ever since, with 10 beautifully appointed tents and prime access to wildlife spotting. The tents all include en-suite bathrooms, as well as running water and multiple showers, so you won't be roughing it here. Oliver's Camp is known for their walking safaris—a rare chance to get out of the vehicle with a guide. Most days at Oliver's Camp include morning drives, afternoon tea, sundowners, and an evening drive, as well as plenty of down time and stargazing at night. And it's a great option for families, as children five and above are welcome.",

We’d happily give it all away for a stay at this drop-dead gorgeous island retreat, where barefoot luxury and a belly full of fresh fish are the only orders of the day. You can’t go wrong with room selection, with traditional \"bures\" clustered either along the beach or strung above the lagoon, the latter accessible only by a wobbly wooden gangplank. Besides location, all that distinguishes huts are private plunge pools and outdoor showers (for those who like a little island breeze where the sun don’t shine). Standouts are the service—expect staff to remember your name, what time you roll out of bed, and how you like your joe—and the food, which is swept into your daily tariff. Chef Shane’s Fijiana, the on-site restaurant, serves up Indian- and Chinese-inspired cuisine via a menu that changes daily—one evening, you’ll inhale a plate of salt and pepper snapper, sprinkled liberally with shreds of green papaya, tamarind sauce, and a spritz of lime, and the next, a crispy kaarage fried chicken coated in hot mustard, pickled ginger, and nori seaweed. Still hungry? The daily continental breakfast buffet deals in fresh-squeezed juice, towers of tropical fruit, and flaky pastries, breads, and yogurts, though we’ll go to bat for the poached mud crab omelette—and tell Shane not to be shy with the chili and papaya relish. Sundays are for family-style Magiti Banquets. When you’re not cracking jokes over piña coladas at Masima or Dua Tale, try tagging along for a jet ski tour of Mondriki Island (of Castaway fame), or hug a paddle board on the azure ocean waters.",

The food at Aux Amis is unabashedly modern French, with attention paid to proper portions in the tropics: in other words, not too much.

What makes New Zealand’s perennial luxury lodge so stand out, however, is not so much the beauty of that epic nature it frames so stylishly from its sun flooded, white-on-white rooms, but rather, the comfort, service, and food to match. And the bar, as set by God with this one, is very high. Fresh water aoraki salmon from lakes carved into New Zealand’s highest peak, Mount Cook, stars alongside local mushrooms and crispy-skinned duck legs at dinner. Wash it down with an Amisfield Chenin Blanc; the team can arrange tastings at the nearby Gibbston Valley, one of the country’s hottest boutique wine districts. Of course, there’s plenty to do on those peaks as well. Take a chopper heli-skiing or head out on an all-day hike in warmer months for phenomenal views down onto Lake Wakatipu. Push yourself on that climb, for there are few sweeter rewards than an after-hike soak in a deep tub, rightly placed against that gorgeous glass wall. Matakauri is the embodiment, from the design to the nature, of New Zealand’s own brand of luxury.",

On an open plain, Sabora has nine tents furnished with antiques from an English lord’s East African campaign in a 1920s style. Faru Faru’s eight tents sit in wooded country by the Grumeti River. A return to the very essence of safari, Singita Explore is a private camp that moves according to where the best game viewing is within the Grumeti Reserves and provides access to the most remote and beautiful locations. Singita Serengeti House, is an exclusive-use retreat designed to welcome friends and families to a relaxed home away from home.

                        "description": "“There were a lot of fun hotels in Palm Springs, but there weren’t any great ones, and I wanted to change this.” So says Steve Hermann, the L.A.-based residential designer who spent the two years (and millions of dollars) turning the historic William F. Cody–designed L’Horizon into a luxurious boutique hotel. Hermann didn’t alter the footprint much—the main house and 25 bungalows were built in 1952 as a vacation spot for Hollywood producer Jack Wrather (of Lassie; The Lone Ranger fame)—but he added an open-air spa and an alfresco restaurant and gut-renovated the interiors. Hermann wanted the decor to work with the mid-century architecture without creating a time warp. As such, each bungalow is a mix of modern (custom hair-on-hide rugs, industrial-chic machined brass lighting and fixtures) and vintage (furniture from Percival Lafer, Mullhauser, Knoll, and Katavolos). The result is in keeping with the original purpose of Cody’s design and Hermann’s background—more luxe residential than hotel, heightened by touches like monogrammed stationery and door plaques inscribed not with room numbers but with guests’ names. And while it is a fun hotel, more private club than frat party, it’s also a place for quiet indulgences: The pool is guests-only; unexpected treats are brought to your room every afternoon (could be a scoop of ice cream, could be a shot of tequila); and roaming poolside therapists offer complimentary foot and shoulder massages. Request a west-facing bungalow with an outdoor shower and watch the sun go down over the San Jacinto Mountains while shampooing.",
